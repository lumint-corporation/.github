#### Motivation:

- High level business context driving the change request
- Source driving business request (client, internal, compliance, other)
- Effect of not implementing or significantly delaying the Change

#### Required Timeframe:

 - Specific dates if required
 - general expecations otherwise
 - list any dependencies prior to work on card
 - list any cards that may by dependent on this card being completed

#### Priority: 

To be completed/reviewed by Change Coordinator:

 - Emergency – A change that must be implemented immediately to avert significantly negative effects, including but not limited to outages or data disclosures.
 - High – A very important change with such criticality that it must be implemented very soon to prevent a significant negative impact.
 - Med – A routine change that will be implemented in the short-term to improve the solution or service.
 - Low – A change that is not critical, may provide minimal benefit, or is not needed immediately but should be made eventually.

#### Category:

To be completed/reviewed by Change Coordinator:

 - Hardware
 - Software
 - Application
 - Database
 - Cloud Service
 - User Account
 - Phone System
 - Collaboration Tool
 - Scheduled Maintenance


#### Complexity Score (also tag cards with 1 -3 label):

To be completed/reviewed by Change Coordinator:

 - 1: Low – Routine and No Difficulty
    - No complexity
    - Low risk
    - Simple implementation
    - Easy back-out, restoration
    - No service agreement impact
 - 2: Med – Mid-level Difficulty
    - Sizable complexity
    - Moderate risk to availability
    - Somewhat involving back-out steps
    - Could affect system security
 - 3: High – High Difficulty
    - Very high complexity
    - High risk to availability
    - Complex back-out requirements
    - Greatly affects data / infrastructure security
    - Impacts service level agreements (SLAs)
    - Outside typical capabilities and expertise
    - External vendor support is necessary

#### Risk Assessment:

To be completed/reviewed by Change Coordinator:

 - Risk/impact of making and not making the change
 - Recognition of timing and conflict resolution
 - Awareness and understanding of possible impact to all parties
 - Affects to down-stream processes or business operations
 - Possible detriment or affects to business objectives

 - User Impact
    - High (4) – Impacts many internal/external customers.  Major disruption to critical systems or impacts critical services.
    - Moderate (3) – Impacts several customers, significant disruption to systems or services.
    - Low (2) – Impacts a minimal number of internal customers, minimal service impact.
    - No Risk (1) – No impact to customers, as well as no impact to systems or services.
 - Engineering Impact
    - High (4) – Involves many or all development resources or requires unstaffed experts.
    - Med (3) – Involves multiple dev resources or requires expertise with limited availability. 
    - Low (2) – Involves only a few dev resources from one workgroup.
    - No Risk (1) – Involves a single dev resource.
 - Complexity
    - High (4) – High complexity requiring technical and business coordination. 
    - Med (3) – Significant complexity requiring technical coordination only. 
    - Low (2) – Low complexity requiring no technical coordination.
    - No Risk (1) – Maintenance type of change.
 - Duration
    - High (4) – Outage greater than 1 hour and affecting users at a peak time.
    - Med (3) – Outage < 1 hour during a peak time, or > 1 hour during a non-peak period.
    - Low (2) – Outage <1 hour during non-prime time and affecting users during off-time.
    - No Risk (1) – No outage expected.
 - Security
    - High (4) – Affects critical data or systems security, or back-out time could be lengthy.
    - Med (3) – Affects non-critical data or systems security and has a moderate back-out plan which should not extend timeframes.
    - Low (2) – No security issues and easy back-out plan.
    - No Risk (1) – No back-out plan needed.
 - Service Level Agreement
    - High (4) – Impacts SLA during prime/peak times.
    - Med (3) – Impacts SLA during non-prime, non-peak times.
    - Low (2) – Little measurable effect on SLA times.
    - No Risk (1) – No effect on SLA times.
Sum all associated risk numbers per category to identify one of the following Risk Levels.

Range	Risk
19 – 24	High
11 – 18	Med
17 – 7	Low
1 – 6	Little


#### Specific Business Requirements:

May include:
 - Requirements and detailed description of the change
 - Impact the change will make on the business unit’s operation
 - Effect the change may have on users, operations, and infrastructure
 - Impact on services that run on the same infrastructure or platform
 - Effect of not implementing or significantly delaying the Change
 - Resources from IT and elsewhere needed to implement the Change
    - Cover the likely costs, number and availability of people needed, estimated time, and additional systems or infrastructure possibly required
